        <h>Context (2/22/2024)</h>
        <p>I started learning Japanese a couple years ago because of my fascination with Japanese culture
            and people. I like Japanese food, Japanese literature, Japanese games, Japanese internet content,
            Japanese manga/anime, and last but not least, Japanese music (I haven't even realized I'm listening
            to JPOP the moment I'm writing this). I'm entirely self-taught. I have an N3 Japanese Language
            Proficiency Test certificate. At this level, I can generally converse with Japanese people about
            topics I'm familiar with and read/watch Japanese content with the occasional use of a dictionary for
            words that are a bit more rare. This means that I'm certainly no expert, but I have gained quite a bit of
            experience related to learning and using Japanese. On this personal "blog", I'd like to share
            some of this experience and my general thoughts related to the Japanese language.
        </p>

        <h>Is Japanese difficult? (2/22/2024)</h>
        <p>As your lawyer might say, <i>it depends</i>...</p>

        <h2>"Japanese is an asian language, greatly different from English!"</h2>
        <p><b>Yes,</b> Japanese has a lot of nuances and the speaking style is completely different because of their culture.
        One of the examples is the use of ます (masu) endings for formal contexts and る (ru) for informal contexts. And even determining
        the context is not intuitive for the most of us.</p>
        <p><b>No,</b> Japanese has a lot of loan words (外来語 - gairaigo), and a lot of the vocabulary can be easily memorized, recognized and used by English speakers.
        For example, メイド (meido) meaning maid, ユーザー (yuuzaa) meaning user, or タクシー (takushii) meaning taxi. In many aspects, it <i>is</i> similar to English.
        </p>

        <h2>"Japanese has all of those symbols that are so difficult to write!"</h2>
        <p><b>Yes,</b> Japanese has three writing systems. Kanji (漢字) being the most complex system in practice. You <i>will</i> forget kanji.</p>
        <p><b>No,</b> in practice, learning hiragana and katakana (the other two systems) doesn't take that long (around a week). Then,
        you naturally train reading them by just reading Japanese. As for kanji, they're not that difficult to learn if you learn words 
        together with their corresponding kanji immediately. In fact, the kanji may even aid you in memorizing the words.</p>

        <p>In reality, every supposed "difficulty" of Japanese has its positive and negative sides. Yes, your Japanese study
            might progress slower than if you were to learn a different language, but that should not demotivate you. With regular
            effort, it should not be that noticeable, as you will see progress anyway. If you think that Japanese is too difficult for you,
            drop that mindset. You'll eventually get the hang of it. As a rule of thumb, don't worry about a language's difficulty.
        </p>

        <h>Disappointing beginnings and accepting them (2/22/2024)</h>
        <p>The disappointing reality you have to accept is that you will not understand <b>anything</b> for a very long time.
        Well, not literally. But when you try to understand anything that might have been your motivation for learning the language,
        for example an anime for Japanese, you will find that you can't comprehend what's going on. It will feel like you haven't
        learn anything. You must accept that most likely, you will experience this, even if you've been learning for 3-6 months.
        The key is patience. With consistent effort and no slowing down, you will eventually understand it. It's good to
        consider some easier goals as well. If it comes to Japanese, there's a <a target="_blank" href="https://jpdb.io">cool website that ranks anime, novels, movies and such by their Japanese difficulty.</a> </p>
